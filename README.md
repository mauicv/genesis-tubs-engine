> Physics engine built in Javascript. Genesis-tubs is a reference to the Simpsons episode in which Lisa puts her tooth in coke for a science project and inadvertently creates life.  

To see examples of this physic engine in action go to [genesistubs](https://www.genesistubs.com)

**Note: this project is poorly and only sporadically maintained**
